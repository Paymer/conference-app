    2.1 Outil json-server:
    
    I have "concurrently" used that to run start-watch and webpack server at the same time :
       - commande installation:  npm i concurrently --save-dev
       - commande: npm run dev 
       - script:  "dev":  "start npm run start && start npm run dist"

    2.2 Service TalkService

    UglyFy deactivated to permit the "concurrently" performance.
